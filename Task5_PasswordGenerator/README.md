🔐 Password Generator – CODSOFT Internship Task 5

Welcome to the final task of my CODSOFT internship journey — a dynamic Password Generator built entirely in Python!  
This task challenged me to blend logic with randomness while building something practical, secure, and surprisingly fun to use.

Passwords are the gatekeepers of our digital lives — so I wanted to create something that’s both simple and strong. With just a few lines of input, you can create a unique password filled with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

🎯 Key Highlights

🧮 User defines the length of the password  
🔀 Password is generated using a mix of letters, digits, and symbols  
💬 Friendly feedback with emoji prompts  
⚠️ Includes input validation to ensure security standards  
🔄 Generates different results every time — truly random!

🧠 What I Learned

This task helped me practice:
- Working with Python's `string` and `random` modules
- Creating smooth, user-driven logic
- Managing input validation with grace
- Turning a utility script into an interactive terminal experience
- Thinking like a user while coding like a developer

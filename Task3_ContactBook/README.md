📘 CODSOFT Internship – Task 3: Contact Book
Hello there! 👋
This repository contains my third task for the CODSOFT Internship — a fully interactive Command-Line Contact Book 🧾💻
A simple yet powerful way to store and manage your contacts — all using core Python! 🐍✨

💡 Overview
Managing contacts is something we all do — so why not code one?
This project allowed me to build a real-world utility tool entirely from scratch. It not only stores contacts but also allows the user to interact with them effortlessly using a terminal interface.

This task was super fun and strengthened my logic-building skills, especially around loops, conditionals, and data handling using lists and dictionaries 🧠💡

🎯 Key Features
🔹 Add Contacts — Store name, phone number, and email with ease
🔹 Search by Name — Find your contact instantly without scrolling
🔹 View All Contacts — See all entries in a clean format
🔹 Delete Contacts — Remove outdated or unwanted entries
🔹 Exit Safely — Ends the session with a polite message ✋😊

✨ Why This Task Matters
This Contact Book might seem simple — but it represents something bigger:
A step towards mastering real-world problem solving using programming.
With this task, I explored how to structure user interaction, sanitize inputs, and give immediate, meaningful feedback — all with a touch of user-friendliness 🌈🖥

🚀 What I Learned
🛠 Writing clean, readable Python code
🗃 Managing dynamic data using lists and dictionaries
🌀 Using loops and conditions to control flow
💬 Designing terminal-based user prompts
📍 Handling input/output creatively with emoji-based feedback

🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game – CODSOFT Internship Task 4

Hello! I'm excited to share my fourth task for the CODSOFT Internship — an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built completely with core Python. This game brings nostalgic fun to the command line with a clean design, looping gameplay, and cheerful emoji feedback.

This task helped me translate a childhood favorite into a mini digital experience while enhancing my logic-building and user-interaction skills. It was a blend of fun and function, and I enjoyed every part of building it.

🧠 What You Can Do in This Game

🪨 Choose Rock, 📄 Paper, or ✂️ Scissors  
💻 Play against a computer opponent with random moves  
🎉 Receive instant win, lose, or draw messages  
🔁 Replay the game as many times as you’d like  
😄 Enjoy a fun, friendly interface built just for the terminal

🎨 Creative Highlights

This game may be small in size but it’s rich in interactivity. From colorless input lines to playful emoji results, I worked on making this terminal game feel lighthearted and enjoyable. I learned how to organize a game into reusable functions and give clear feedback to the user through meaningful prompts.
